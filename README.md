# springboot-demo

This is an introductory demo project for building RESTful services using Spring Boot that I made following this: 
https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/

You can just follow along the guide to see what it does, it takes like 15 minutes, but the end result allows you to test the /greeting service at localhost:8080/greeting and optionally setting the query string parameter called "name" to get different greetings.
